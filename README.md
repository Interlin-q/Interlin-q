# Distributed Quantum Interconnect Simulator

This is a distributed quantum-enabled simulator which imitates the master-slave centralised-control distributed quantum computing system with interconnect communication between the nodes. Using this simulator, one can input any monolithic circuit as well as a distributed quantum computing topology and see the execution of the distributed algorithm happening in real time. The simulator maps the monolithic circuit to a distributed quantum computing achitecture and uses a master-slave relation with a centralized controller communicating to computing nodes in the network. The method used to accomplish this is based on the following (in review) paper:
