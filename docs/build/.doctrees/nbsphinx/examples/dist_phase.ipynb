    "# Distributed Quantum Phase Estimation Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum phase estimation is a quantum algorithm which is used to estimate the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. If we consider a unitary matrix $U$ and a quantum state  $|\\psi \\rangle$  such that $U|\\psi \\rangle =e^{2\\pi i\\theta }$, the algorithm estimates the value of $\\theta$  with high probability within additive error $\\varepsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below is the circuit diagram for quantum phase estimation with the Unitary $U$ and eigenstate $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](../images/quantum_phase_estimation_diagram.png \"Quantum Phase Estimation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will explain the execution of distributed quantum phase estimation algorithm with two computing hosts and one controller host using Interlin-q. We let the first computing host `QPU_1` possess all the qubits which are set in the state $|0\\rangle$ from the above image and the second computing host `QPU_2` would possess the single qubit which is set in the eigenstate $|\\psi\\rangle$.\n",

    "\n",
    "![alt text](../images/simulated_architechture.png \"Simulated Architechture\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The controller host gets the monolithic circuit as an input from the client, converts it to a distributed circuit and generates schedules from it for individual computing hosts and broadcasts it to them. The controller host and all the computing hosts share a global clock. When the computing hosts receive the broadcast, they extract their schedule from it and perform the operations in the schedules according to the global clock and the timestamps on the operations. The final results are sent over to the controller host from all the computing hosts for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conversion of monolithic to distributed circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "The monolithic circuit is a circuit which is designed to be implemented by a single quantum computer. To implement this same algorithm using multiple interlinked quantum computers, this monolithic circuit needs to be converted to a distributed circuit over a given topology of the interlinked quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution is performed by the controller host, by analysing the input monolithic circuit and searching for any control gates where the control and target qubits lie in separate computing host. If any such control gate is found, it is replaced by using a Cat-circuit shown in the image below. The controller host generates the distributed circuit by replacing all such control gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](../images/cat-circuit.png \"Cat circuit\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the quantum state $|\\psi_1\\rangle$ lies with the first computing host and the quantum state $|\\psi_2\\rangle$ lies with the second computing host. A control gate with $|\\psi_1\\rangle$ as control qubit and $|\\psi_2\\rangle$ as the target qubit is replaced with the circuit shown, which implement a non-local control gate. It is necessary for both the computing hosts to share an EPR pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distributed Scheduler and Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "The controller host forms a distributed schedule of operations according to timestamps for individual computing hosts using the distributed circuit. The operations are timestamped after considering the amount of time the operation would take to be performed on the specific computing hosts. These operations are then broadcasted to all the computing hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executing the distributed algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The computings hosts receive the broadcasted schedules and extract their schedule from it. The controller hosts and all the computing hosts share a Clock object, which enable them to perform operations according to the schedule in synchronization. Once the operations are performed, and resulting error or successful measurements are reported back to the controller host, who further processes the output for the client.\n",
